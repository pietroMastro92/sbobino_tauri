### Summary
Transcript-specific display controls belong in the right inspector, not in the left navigation sidebar.

### Details
The confidence-color toggle for transcript rendering was initially added to the left app sidebar. User feedback clarified that this control must live in the right inspector panel, next to transcript-specific controls, because it affects the currently open detail view rather than global navigation.

### Suggested Action
When adding transcript, segment, or detail-view options, prefer the right inspector unless the control changes app-level navigation or global layout.

### Summary
Tooltip pointers for animated overlays should not live inside the same element that is being clipped during the morph animation.

### Details
The transcript confidence tooltip still rendered without a visible arrow after multiple CSS tweaks because the pointer was implemented as a child of the bubble element while the bubble itself used `clip-path` for the genie animation. That made the arrow easy to clip away or misplace even when its own CSS looked correct. Moving the pointer to a sibling wrapper tied to the portal shell fixes the visibility and positioning problem.

### Suggested Action
For future tooltip or popover animations in sbobino, separate shell motion, bubble masking, and arrow rendering into different layers instead of animating everything inside one clipped node.

### Summary
When polishing UI motion, user-visible artifacts like arrow direction and tinted borders matter more than subtle animation tweaks.

### Details
The tooltip animation for transcript confidence was adjusted toward a more fluid "genie" motion, but the resulting UI still looked wrong to the user because the arrow shape appeared inverted and the bubble border inherited an unwanted confidence-tinted outline. The takeaway is that animation polish should not ship before core visual correctness is nailed down, especially for overlays where arrow geometry and neutral chrome are immediately noticeable.

### Suggested Action
For future overlay and tooltip polish in sbobino, first verify arrow orientation, border treatment, and perceived visual hierarchy from a screenshot or live render, then iterate on motion styling.

### Summary
For Sbobino release debugging, runtime verification on a clean target Mac must be treated as a separate problem from GitHub release publication.

### Details
Repeated release attempts mixed three different failure classes into one loop: GitHub prerelease publishing, first-launch provisioning, and runtime executable validation. The latest user screenshot shows a different class of issue than the earlier missing-asset failures: `ffmpeg` is present in the managed runtime path but exits with `SIGABRT`. That means the release pipeline may already be good enough to deliver the artifact, while the real blocker has shifted to managed runtime linkage or environment setup on the target Mac. The better workflow is to freeze the release shape once remote assets are coherent, then investigate the target-Mac runtime failure directly with binary diagnostics instead of continuing to churn release operations.

### Suggested Action
When first-launch setup fails after successful download and extraction, switch immediately to runtime crash investigation on the managed install: inspect `otool -L`, `codesign`, `DYLD_*` behavior, and stderr/crash output for the managed binaries before doing more release reshaping.
