# Sbobino Desktop Rewrite (Tauri v2 + Rust Clean Architecture)

This repository is the production-grade rewrite of the original Python Sbobino app.

## Workspace Layout

- `crates/domain`: pure business model and rules
- `crates/application`: use cases and ports (interfaces)
- `crates/infrastructure`: adapters (whisper/ffmpeg/gemini/filesystem/sqlite)
- `apps/desktop`: React presentation layer
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri`: Tauri command host and runtime composition
- `docs/architecture.md`: architecture and dependency rules
- `docs/release-and-migration.md`: release pipeline and migration plan
- `docs/feature-migration-matrix.md`: feature-by-feature parity checklist

## Quick Start

1. Install Rust stable and Node 20+.
2. `cd apps/desktop`
3. `npm ci`
4. `npm run tauri:dev`

## Runtime Setup (first run)

From workspace root:

1. `./scripts/setup_runtime.sh` (downloads `ggml-base.bin` into app data models dir)
2. In app, keep `Model = Base` for first run.
3. For release builds, run `./scripts/setup_bundled_pyannote.sh` before `npm run tauri:build` so CI can publish the separate pyannote setup assets for first launch.
4. The DMG no longer bundles the full local runtime. On first launch the app installs FFmpeg, Whisper CLI, Whisper Stream, Whisper models, and pyannote assets into app data through the guided setup flow.

## Current Milestone

- Initial clean architecture scaffold
- First background transcription command
- Progress/completion events to frontend
- Minimal working desktop UI
