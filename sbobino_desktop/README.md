# Sbobino Desktop Rewrite (Tauri v2 + Rust Clean Architecture)

This repository is the production-grade rewrite of the original Python Sbobino app.

## Workspace Layout

- `crates/domain`: pure business model and rules
- `crates/application`: use cases and ports (interfaces)
- `crates/infrastructure`: adapters (whisper/ffmpeg/gemini/filesystem/sqlite)
- `apps/desktop`: React presentation layer
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri`: Tauri command host and runtime composition
- `docs/architecture.md`: architecture and dependency rules
- `docs/release-and-migration.md`: release pipeline and migration plan
- `docs/feature-migration-matrix.md`: feature-by-feature parity checklist
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`: licenses and attribution for FFmpeg, whisper.cpp, pyannote, Hugging Face models, and related runtime components
- `docs/github-release-template.md`: copy-paste text for GitHub Release notes (third-party disclaimer + links)

## Quick Start

1. Install Rust stable and Node 20+.
2. `cd apps/desktop`
3. `npm ci`
4. `npm run tauri:dev`

## Runtime Setup (first run)

From workspace root:

1. `./scripts/setup_runtime.sh` (downloads `ggml-base.bin` into app data models dir)
2. In app, keep `Model = Base` for first run.
3. For public local releases, run `./scripts/setup_bundled_pyannote.sh` only to hydrate the source assets that will be zipped as separate first-launch provisioning artifacts.
4. The public DMG does not bundle pyannote or the full local runtime. On first launch the app installs FFmpeg, Whisper CLI, Whisper Stream, Whisper models, and pyannote assets into app data through the guided setup flow.

## Local Release

Use `./scripts/prepare_local_release.sh <version>` from `sbobino_desktop/` to build and validate a macOS Apple Silicon candidate release locally without publishing anything to GitHub. The default `public` profile prepares a lightweight DMG, keeps pyannote out of the app bundle, signs the updater artifacts with a stable local Tauri updater keypair, and writes the full candidate folder into `dist/local-release/v<version>`.

That folder now always includes:
- `Sbobino_<version>_aarch64.dmg`
- `Sbobino.app.tar.gz`
- `Sbobino.app.tar.gz.sig`
- `latest.json`
- `setup-manifest.json`
- `runtime-manifest.json`
- `speech-runtime-macos-aarch64.zip`
- `pyannote-manifest.json`
- `pyannote-runtime-macos-aarch64.zip`
- `pyannote-model-community-1.zip`
- `release-readiness-proof.json` (generated only when `release_readiness.sh` passed)

Manual publish contract:
1. build the release locally
2. publish the GitHub release for the same `v<version>` as stable by default
3. upload the full asset set
4. run `./scripts/distribution_readiness.sh <version>`
5. test that exact GitHub release on a second Apple Silicon Mac
6. use a prerelease only when you explicitly want a candidate-first flow
7. if it fails, retire that release and cut a new patch version

Helper scripts:
- `./scripts/publish_candidate_release.sh <version>` publishes a stable release by default and refuses publishing if readiness proof/checksums/manifests are inconsistent
- `./scripts/promote_candidate_release.sh <version>`
- `./scripts/retire_failed_candidate.sh <version>`

Stable release policy:
- never overwrite or “fix in place” a stable GitHub release
- prereleases are optional and no longer the default publish mode
- the default promotion flow removes older stable releases so only the latest validated stable remains public

Set `SBOBINO_RELEASE_PROFILE=standalone-dev` only for internal/offline builds that intentionally embed bundled pyannote assets.

## Open source and third-party licenses

Sbobino Desktop is released under the **MIT License** ([`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). Binary releases and first-launch provisioning also redistribute or install other open-source software (FFmpeg, whisper.cpp, Python, pyannote, PyTorch stack, and CC-BY-4.0 model data from Hugging Face). See **[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)** for version pins, links, and compliance notes. When publishing a GitHub Release, use **[`docs/github-release-template.md`](docs/github-release-template.md)** as a starting point for user-facing notes.

## Current Milestone

- Initial clean architecture scaffold
- First background transcription command
- Progress/completion events to frontend
- Minimal working desktop UI
